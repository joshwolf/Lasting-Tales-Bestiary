# Lasting Tales Bestiary

This is a web app meant to be a digital, searchable repository of the Bestiary from the game [Lasting Tales](https://www.blacklistgamesllc.com/lastingtales).

This app merely provides a platform for adding/editing and viewing the data- you must supply your own content, which you can add via the app if you are logged in.

## Requirements

This app is meant to run on Firebase, and assumes that you're working with a project there that has a Firestore database and Email/Password authentication.

The app is built in Vue 3 and uses Tailwind and DaisyUI.

### TO DO:
- Mobile cleanup
- Create scenario options based on selected creatures + party level
